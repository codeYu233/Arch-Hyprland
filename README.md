# Arch-Hyprland

## Auto-install.sh for my archlinux-hyprland
This repo contains an auto-install.sh and many install-scripts for apps that my arch-hyprland needed.

> [!CAUTION]
> Attention! This is not my dotfile.

## You just want the dotfiles?
Click here [codeyu233's arch-dotfiles](https://github.com/codeYu233/Arch-dotfiles)

## How to use?
Make sure you have installed the up-to-date archlinux operating system.
Then just run :
```bash
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeyu233/Arch-Hyprland/main/auto-install.sh)
```
This command will install my entire hyprland desktop to your operating system.

## Tips
If you get stuck during the installation process,check your network,and if you're using a virtual machine,check your virtual machine's memory、processor allocation.(hyprland is not recommended on virtual machines)

If there are some problems with the apps' download sources,I can do nothing : (
Please tell me (I'll update the source) and install those apps manually,thx!

## Todo
- Make a update.sh
- Make a showcase video
